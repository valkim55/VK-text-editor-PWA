# Progressive Web Application - Text Editor J.A.T.E 

Welcome to JATE - text editor/progressive web application that can be installed on user's local machine and used independently from the browser. The main benefit of using this app is that even if the user is experiencing difficulty with internet connection it will not affect the functionality of the app or cause any data loss.<br>

> ### Technology
- the application was developed with Node.js and browser engine. <em><strong>IndexedDB</strong></em> was used to store the data in the browser memory, the user is able to query the database to add, delete and update information in the database. <br>
<em><strong>- webpack</strong></em> - a tool that helps to transform and compress the files to decrease occupied memory space, is used to compress the files on 'build' <br>
<em><strong>- babel</strong></em> compiles a newest version of the code to work with even older browser versions <br>
<em><strong>- service worker</strong></em> controls how to process HTTP requests coming from the browser<br>

> ### Installation
Once the repository is cloned to a local machine, run '<em><strong>npm install</strong></em>' to install al necessary dependencies.<br>
After that you can run '<em><strong>npm run build</strong></em> and this command will 'build' a <em><strong>dist</strong></em> directory from which an index.html file can be accessed.
